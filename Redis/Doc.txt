-- remote dictionary server (it is a in memory database us as a cash that improve the performanfe the databases)
	multiModel database

	we have the redis core that store the key values data and extend it by redis modules
	
	
	data persistent
		the first way that we can have replica(but is not safe)
		the safe ways{
			snapshoting(RDB) -> by event time or ...
			Appand only file -> the file for each log



	scale the redis
		clustering (replica with one master can read and write and slave just read)
		sharding (distributed in may server)



	work with redis is easy 
		at first we can use it on docker by dis command
			docker run --name redis -p 6379:6379 redis
		and by this we run the server of the redis
		
		we can have the cli of the redis for use to set key value
			SET key value
		for get the value of the key
			GET key
		for delete the key
			DEL key
		for check existing key
			EXISTS key
		for check all key that existed
			KEYS *
		for emptey the redis memory 
			flushall
