Nosql database is the likly to not only sql (not infront of Sql).
	types {
		Document db =>  store data in documents similar to JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) objects. Each document contains pairs of fields and values. The values can typically be a variety of types including things like strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, or objects.
		Key-value db => are a simpler type of database where each item contains keys and values.
		Wide-column db => stores store data in tables, rows, and dynamic columns.
		Graph db => store data in nodes and edges. Nodes typically store information about people, places, and things, while edges store information about the relationships between the nodes.

	difference of RDBMS(relational data base management system) Vs. NoSQL
		in RDBMS we should to seprate the data to the tables that have a relation with each other, that means when we need the data we have to join some tables and it's may take more time when we have many query.
		in Nosql we have all the information in one index table.(we can have relation in here)
